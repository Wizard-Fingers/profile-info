Imagine you are building your own social media website. Come up with a name and colour scheme for your site.

Create a component called ProfileInfo. We are going to simulate a profile search results screen. The ProfileInfo component should display a users profile picture, name, age and location.

- Hint: to give the component a different profile picture each time, you may want to use a string to represent its filepath
- Extension
- Implement a random user generator API - https://randomuser.me/

- Implement a sidebar that shows you who you’ve contacted with a friend request. You’ll need to put a friend request button on each profile component
